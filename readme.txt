Improves the appearance of WordPress images for better click through rates from social and search sites.

== Description ==

<!-- about -->

**Have you noticed that WordPress creates small images that are a bit "fuzzy" - nothing like the nice sharp original you uploaded?**

After resizing an image, the image must be sharpened but WordPress doesn't do any sharpening, so the resized image remains a bit "fuzzy" - not what you want for a featured image or shared image on social sites! The WPSSO Tune WP Image Editors (WPSSO TIE) add-on provides this missing WordPress image sharpened feature - it automatically applies sharpening to all JPEG images resized by the WordPress ImageMagick library.

**Compatible with all image compression / optimization plugins:**

Image sharpening is applied during the WordPress resize operation so the resulting images can still be optimized with any compression / optimization plugin.
