WPSSO Core add-on to provide tuning options for the WordPress image editors and PHP image extensions.

== Description ==

<img class="readme-icon" src="https://surniaulula.github.io/wpsso-tune-image-editors/assets/icon-256x256.png">

Have you noticed that after carefully adjusting an image in Photoshop, you upload it to your site and WordPress creates small images that seems a bit "fuzzy" &mdash; nothing like the nice sharp original?

The reason is that after resizing any image, <em>that image must be sharpened – always</em>, but WordPress doesn’t do any sharpening, so the resized image remains a bit "fuzzy" &mdash; probably not what you want for a featured image or share on social sites! ;-)

The WPSSO Tune WP Image Editors add-on takes care of this &mdash; it automatically applies a reasonable amount of sharpening to all JPEG images resized by the WordPress ImageMagick editor.

<h3>WPSSO Core Plugin Prerequisite</h3>

WPSSO Tune WP Image Editors (aka WPSSO TIE) is an add-on for the WPSSO Core plugin &mdash; which creates complete &amp; accurate meta tags and Schema markup from your existing content for social sharing, Social Media Optimization (SMO), Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Google Rich Cards, Pinterest Rich Pins, and more.

The Free add-on works with either the Free or Pro version of WPSSO Core. The [WPSSO TIE Pro add-on](https://wpsso.com/extend/plugins/wpsso-tune-image-editors/?utm_source=wpssotie-readme) uses many WPSSO Core Pro features and requires an active and licensed [WPSSO Core Pro plugin](https://wpsso.com/?utm_source=wpssotie-readme).
