Improves the appearance of WordPress images for better click through rates from social and search sites.

== Description ==

<p><img class="readme-icon" src="https://surniaulula.github.io/wpsso-tune-image-editors/assets/icon-256x256.png"> <strong>Have you noticed that WordPress creates small images that seems a bit "fuzzy" - nothing like the nice sharp original you uploaded?</strong></p>

The reason is that after an image is resized, that image *must* be sharpened - but WordPress doesn't do any sharpening, so the resized image remains a bit "fuzzy" - not what you want for a featured image or shared image on social sites! ;-)

The WPSSO Tune WP Image Editors (WPSSO TIE) add-on provides this missing WordPress feature - it automatically applies sharpening to all JPEG images resized by the WordPress ImageMagick library.

**Compatible with all image compression / optimization plugins:**

Image sharpening / adjustments are applied during the WordPress image resize operation, so the resulting resized image / thumbnail can be optimized afterwards as usual.

<h3>Users Love the WPSSO TIE Add-on</h3>
